<TITLE>Shortcuts -- /LineMode</TITLE>
<NEXTID 4>
<H1>Shortcuts</H1>To save having always to go through the <A NAME=1 HREF=QuickGuide.html>www</A> default page, you can
use a shortcut to get to an index. On cernvax, the following shell
commands are predefined:
<DL>
<DT>yellow
<DD> The CERN yellow pages telephone directory.
<DT>xfind
<DD> The CERN computer center documentation keyword index
<DT>vmnews
<DD> The CERN computer centre news service: all news articles, in
reverse chronological order.
</DL>
You can search an index which has a shortcut command by giving the
keywords as parameters, eg
<XMP>			yellow taxes


</XMP>To make your own shortcuts, you can define your own commands. On unix
(with csh), use an alias (see <A NAME=2 HREF=VMS_Shortcuts.html>VMS equiavlent</A>):
<XMP>			alias  z www  address

</XMP>where address is the hypertext address of the document you want to
jump into. You can find the hypertext address of a node from the <A NAME=3 HREF=Commands.html#2>LIST</A>
command or the RECALL command when you are in www. (For nodes with
titles, the RECALL command shows you that instead).<P>
An alternative method uses a shell script.<P>
