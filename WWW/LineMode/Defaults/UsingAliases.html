<H1>Using aliases</H1>Under unix, you can set up your own www command using an alias, even
if you do not have system privileges.  (See <A NAME=1 HREF=Installation_VMS.html>seperate info for VMS</A>
).<P>
The commands below are for the C shell (csh). If you are using the
korn shell, you will replace the space between the name and value
of an alias with an equals "=" sign.<P>
To define the www command, simply make an alias to the executable
file (www) in the directory in which you have put it.
<XMP>			alias www  /path/path/path/Implementaion/machine/www

</XMP>If you want to make a special command to point directly to a particular
hypertext document, then you must find its hypertext address. You
then define an alias giving that address as a first parameter to "www".
<XMP>			alias xfind www http://crnvmc/FIND/pub+user\?

</XMP>Note the backslash (\) used to prevent the question mark (here part
of the address of the FIND index) from being interpreted by the shell.
