<H1>Installation under VMS</H1>To install under VMS, get the save set, WWW.BCK, and unwrap it with
the command<P>
$ BACKUP WWW.BCK/SAV [...]<P>
(or else copy the files from a system you know has them). To set up
the commands, put the command
<XMP>			$ @[...]SETUP

</XMP>into your LOGIN.COM, or the system SYLOGIN.COM.  This command file
assumes you have left all the distributed files  in the same directory
as itself.
<H2>Home page</H2>Under VMS,  the home page may be defined using the logical name WWW_HOME.
You should define this to be the full address of the document which
you want to be displayed when www is invoked without parameters. 
For example,
<XMP>        $ DEFINE/SYSTEM WWW_HOME "file://myvax/sys$library/default.html"

</XMP>Users may of course override the system logical name with their own.

length limit) on decnet as PRIAM. You must therefore:
