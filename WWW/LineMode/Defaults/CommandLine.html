</XMP>With no arguments, the <A NAME=1 HREF=QuickGuide.html>www</A> shell command allows you to browse from
the system default page,  /usr/lib/WWW/default.html.<P>

<DD>Non-interactive mode.  Outputs the formatted document to the standard
output, then exits.  Pages are delimited with form feed (FF) characters.
<DT>-pn
<DD> where n is a number, specifies the page length. Without a number,
makes the page length infinite. Default is 23. 
<DT>-v
<DD> Verbose mode: Gives a running commentary on the program's attempts
to read data in various ways.If present, the next argument is the
hypertext address of  the document at which you want to start browsing.

index.
<DT>-a
<DD> Hides anchor positions in the text. Useful, when printing out the
document.

Any further command line arguments are taken as keywords. The first
argument must refer to an index in this case. The index is serached
for entries matching the keywords, and a list of matching entries
is displayed. ______________________________________________________
