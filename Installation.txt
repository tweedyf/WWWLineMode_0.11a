                                                       Installation -- /LineMode

                                 INSTALLATION

   This section describes how to install the line mode browser[1] .   First of
   all, 

       If you have a VMS machine, then see the special instuctions for VMS[2] .

       If you have not already got hold of the files, see the section on
       getting them[3] . 

   The browser  has already been ported to VAX/Ultrix, VAX/VMS (read the
   special instructions[4] ), Sun4, IBM RS6000, and apollo_m68k. If your
   machine is not one of these,  see the section on porting[5] . If it is, then
   find the relevant subdirectory of LineMode/Implementation. 
COMPILING
   This will not be necessary if there is already a copy of the executable for
   your machine in the subdirectory. 

       Check the directory definitions in the Makfile in that subdirectory, and
       change them if necessary. If the file www does not exist, type "make". 
       See the definition of the macros in the file
       Implementation/CommonMakefile[6] . 

INSTALLING

       Become superuser (su root).  If you can't do this,  it is possible to
       set up your own private www command using aliases[7]. 

       Type "make install". Two soft links will be made from system directories
       into the WWW directory tree. These will be to a copy of the executable
       in a  "Works" subdirectory of your machine subdirectory. 

   You must now check that the default "Home" page works, and customise it if
   it is not what you want. The default home page refers explictly to certain
   information which we know about. You may wish to add more.
